#### How to use
In order for this to work, you must have remote connections via HTTP enabled on your XMBC/Kodi device.

Once that's enabled, you'll need to edit `.env.default` with the necessary values. (it's self explanatory)
Then, you're all set. I haven't added a fancy UI yet so for now you'll have to run the command once through the command line and let it sit in the background.
`npm install`
`npm start`
